# the aim of this is to have code for clustering data on the 2 logics(persona , academics)
# so that we can just cluster user data on the logics we define
#we define the features used for clustering, we define K
# seeing the centroids and the background things let AI give names to the clusters

# we can obviously use our pretrained models but how about the case when all of the user data belongs to cluster1 of our pretrained model(that is the way, in which the data differs, is not the same way as the training data differed )

# that means we can just import our clustering code and let it cluster the user data based on how it differs

# this way we make it data independent

# what about mayank's model
# i think we can use our existing models
